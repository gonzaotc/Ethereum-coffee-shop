## Next.js app to send caffees and messages through ethereum test-net

To be able to use it, connect your wallet with MetaMask in the Goerli' ethereum testnet. <br/>
 <br/>
Try it by yourself: https://smart-coffe-shop-b52ewting-gonzaotc.vercel.app/ <br/>

 ## Tech stack used:
 - Next.js + React.js for the interface logic.
 - Ethers.js to handle interaction between the UI and the blockchain. In this case, writting and reading from the ethereum testnet.
 - Hardhat as development environment.
 - Solidity for the Smart Contract.
 - TailwindCSS for faster UI styles development.

## Learning history
- This was my first time using ethers.js, doing a wallet-sign-in, and one of my first smart contracts!.
- I struggled a lot learning how to interact with the blockchain, estimating gas prices and making sure everything goes well, but in the end i had too much fun.
- Seeing my own contract working was so motivating!, pushed me to go forward, as in the next projects I implemented multi-chain handling and sign-in, better UX for the transactions and more complex smart contracts.
